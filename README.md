# Team Assignment 2  

### Authors:

## Hardware Modifications  
- **Camera System:** Replaced the **Oak-D Stereo Camera** with a **Raspberry Pi Camera**.  
- **Motor System:** Substituted the **TurtleBot4's motor driver and motors** with **servo motors**, which function as propellers for the BLIMP.
